# TFS Lua API UI (WIP)

This repository contains the necessary cdoe to have a very basic UI that enables you to perform some actions on the server ([TFS](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver)) via web using a Lua API. 

We are using [Znote AAC](https://github.com/znote/znoteaac) for the early development. If everything goes well, it should be usable in other AACs as well in the future. It is worth noting that this project is still in an early stage, thus the WIP in the title.

###Getting Started

Just copy api_ui.php + lua_api directory (with its contents) inside the directory where you have your Znote AAC and you are set to go!
